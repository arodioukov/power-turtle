Hi!

In this lesson you will be sending commands to a robot turtle,
telling it to move around the grey area on the left.
There is a text area on the right of the page where you can enter the commands.

When you are ready, press the `>` button to the right.

---

To send your first command to the turtle robot,
type this command into the text area on the right and press the `enter` key:

    (forward 50)

The turtle will move forward, leaving a line behind it.

---

You can command the turtle to turn `left` and `right`.

Try sending these commands one at a time:

    (right 30)
    (forward 50)
    (left 30)
    (forward 50)

The number you send indicates how far to move in pixels,
or how far to turn in degrees.

---

You can make more complex commands by combining these commands.
To do several commands in a row you can combine them with `do`:

    (do
      (right 120)
      (forward 50)
      (right 120)
      (forward 50))

---

If you press the `up` arrow from the text area,
it will bring the last command back so that you can execute it again.
If you make a mistake typing a command you can just press `up` and fix it,
instead of retyping the whole thing.

You can press `up` and `down` to move backward and forward between the history of things you wrote in the text area.

---

You can name a combination of commands using `defn`:

    (defn zig []
      (forward 50)
      (right 120)
      (forward 50))

And then you can call your new command by name just like any other command:

    (zig)

---

Commands can take an input and call other commands using that input:

    (defn zag [x]
      (forward x)
      (left x)
      (forward x))

`x` represents the input to the command.
We could have called it something else if we wanted to.
Try passing a number to the `zag` command:

    (zag 100)

---

Try using your new commands together:

    (do
      (zig)
      (zag 100)
      (zig)
      (zag 50))

---

Some special commands take other commands as input.

    (repeat 3 zig)

Will call `zig` 3 times. Notice that `zig` is not inside `()`.

The `(zig)` mean execute the command now,
`zig` without `()` is just the name of the command.

---

At the bottom of a screen is a list of other useful commands.
You can click on them to get more information about what they do.
