@Elango:

I'm Elango, and this is Tim.

I'll be talking about Logo;
Timothy will be talking about combining Logo with a ClojureScript REPL.

This talk presents our personal views, not those of our employers.

# Learning via Logo

# Logo and Clojure

# Clojure and reach

???

# Overview

This talk will be about:
* why Logo is a compelling learning environment
* how Logo relates to Clojure
* how Clojure can expand its potential audience in surprising ways

* Logo is a programming language to control a robot turtle.
* The turtle is represented as a triangle.
* You send movement commands to the turtle instructing it where to go.
* When the pen is down, wherever the turtle goes, it draws a line.

* Currently many efforts to teach kids programming
  - Blockly - a JS library for graphical code created at Google
  - Other things based on Blockly (code.org, physical games for kids with coding component)
* You can see the Logo origin
  - Moving character with spatial commands, structuring commands
  - Even in similarity of Blockly blocks <-> Logo code blocks
    * As Lispers, Logo code blocks -> Lisp forms without parens
* Irony:
  - we start our lives in Lisp - easy to learn programming
  - then program with semi-colons & curly braces
  - then we come back to Lisp - unrivalled power and simplicity
* Which begs the question:
  - if the same thing is good for beginners and very advanced users...
  - ...then why do we avoid it in between?

Notes for further reference:

 Insert explanation of Blockly being a Lisp (or at least Lisp-like??)
 - composition of fns
 - HOFs (via nested blocks)
 - regularity of "syntax"
 - lack of explicit types

  - took a class at age 10
  - only could learn enough for a guessing game

TODO: insert drawing an E, and other things

* Logo - I loved learning it:
  - took a class in middle school, at age 11
  - easy to pick up
  - drew random pictures
  - learned how to create more complex pics
    * fns & recursion to assist
  - renewed my interest in programming

# What makes Logo interesting

* Easy to learn
* Exploration
* Empowerment

???

# What makes Logo interesting

* Logo is an environment that is:
  - simple
  - interactive
  - visual
* Exploration-based learning often as mode of instruction
  - User learning how to interact & manipulate the environment
  - Gives sense of:
    * self-discovery, excitement, wonder
    * empowerment

* Interactivity means:
  - more than just one sense (vision <- also sound, touch)
  - more than just output (also input)
* A physical object makes it "real"
  - tangible
  - relatable
  - connected to reality, not abstract

# Philosophical design

* main goals: interactivity & exploration - first & foremost
  - Seymour Papert
    * Knowledge = systems we create, to absorb new info
      - Those systems must be based on existing knowledge systems we created
    * Knowledge acquisition happens best when:
      - We can relate new info to existing knowledge in a personal way
      - We are put in control of our own learning
    * Created Logo just as a means to exemplify his theory

### Act 2:
# Logo in Clojure

# Learning Clojure

* How to begin? and proceed?
* Examples abstract
* Like the Unix CLI
* Can it get better?

???

# Show, then tell -- but now in Clojure

* Elango's story of learning Clojure
  - Didn't know which reference resource to use
  - Didn't feel comfortable setting up environment in CLI
  - Reading about seqs, data structures, and core fns felt abstract
  - Fns like learning Unix CLI tools - don't know the perfect tool unless you already know it
  - Have to keep bashing your head against a wall until you learn it all
* Meanwhile, Logo is also a Lisp

* I know I did.
* What about trying to introduce someone to Clojure?

* We want learners to transcend Logo

  - in Clojure

Let's take a closer look at one of the lessons

* Lesson 1
* triangle
* square
* offset square
* param for octagon
* Can anyone describe how to draw a circle?
* concentric circles
* spirals
  - like circles, like concentric circles...
  - how can you move from small to large?


    (defn step [x]
      (forward x)
      (right 30))

  - Sequences needed for incremental increase in distance travelled


    (range 10)
    (map step (range 10))

  - Because this is a REPL we don't need to explain laziness yet
  - But we can already talk about modifying a sequence 


    (defn exp [x]
      (* x x 0.1))
    (map exp (range 40))
    (map step (map exp (range 40)))

* We're writing Clojure.
* There is a canvas where we can see a product of our efforts
* There are lessons to guide beginners through core concepts
* Each concept suggests examples to try
* There is a progression of concepts...
  - call a function
  - combine functions into new functions
  - repeat functions
  - create sequences
  - and modify sequences

# Show, then tell

* Functions/HOF were the hard part for beginner students
  - Problems occur when explaining before internalization
  
* From our experience:
  - Show first, encourage practice, then explain
  - just show them fn & repeat
    - They get it.
  - In Blockly, repeat (HOF) is made by nested blocks inside a block

@ Elango


* Progression becomes impt
  - Macros
    * We sometimes introduce macros midway through our lessons
    * Don't need to create them to use them
  - The 'list' fn
    * Probably don't need it except when writing macros
  - The 'vector' fn
    * Probably don't need it except when transposing nested data
  - cons cell
    * Probably don't need it until writing a custom lazy seq
* Papert:
  - visual and interactive is necessary but not sufficient
  - new info must relate to existing knowledge
* Clojure and Logo
  - Logo - simple & small set of primitives
    * Allows people internalize easily
  - Likewise, we can teach Clojure by starting with a small core of primitives
  - Clojure vs. Logo
    * Easy to learn everything there is to Logo because its core is small
    * Clojure has much larger core, so ordering matters much more

* Perhaps you have a lesson in mind that you want to teach?
* Good news! Lessons are markdown text files
* Markdown is very easy to edit
* Your Markdown can be loaded remotely by url
  - you can deliver your own lesson with a link
  - you don't need us to do anything
* Please contribute lessons so that we can link to them in the lesson list
  - just send us the markdown and we'll include it
* As an educator, you get to decide what lessons are best for your situation

Here is some feedback I received about the existing lessons:

> “It was quite astounding how Noah went off on his own tangent to draw his own patterns about half way through the lesson!”

* This is exactly what I had hoped for.
* Lessons are guides, but you can really do whatever you want.
* The emphasis is on self discovery.

* In other news...
* I'm currently learning Korean
  - fascinating culture and language.
* The writing system is unique in that it was designed for literacy,
  unlike most other writing systems.
* The characters are actually very logical, but learning the vocabulary is still hard.
* Alex - friend from Korea - "How did you learn programming?"
  - "I learnt English. Then I went to an Australian University. Now I work at Microsoft."
* Sounds easy, but that's a decade of dedication
* It's hard to imagine how long it would be before I could code in Korean
* Only 5% of the world speaks English as their first language.
* 20% if you include non-native speakers.
* For most people who want to learn programming, the answer is:
  "Awesome! Go learn English first."
* But I knew Elango had translated Clojure to Thamil and I wondered if we could do that for other languages too

# Parlez vous Clojure?

* I'm pretty sure Clojure is a French word right?
* I think it's strange but Elango and I hear a common response to programming in another language;
  "They're going to have to learn English anyway."
* That’s missing something that I want to point out: Translations are great!
  - I'm sure you know geometry... it’s Greek! Someone translated it for you.
  - Astronomy? Latin
  - Einstein’s work? German
  - Marie Curie’s work? French
  - Translations are just plain useful  
  - They are also super easy in Clojure, almost no effort, so why not?

Elango had already translated Thamil and released a library called clj-thamil:
  * It works great in Clojure
  * It relies on macro-writing macros, which does not work in ClojureScript
  * So we made something new

# ClojureScript REPLs

## Klipse

Blogs, website, documentation

![Klipse](img/klipse.gif)

## Replumb

More effort, more control

???

* Perhaps you are interested in building something like Power Turtle yourself.
* Here's how you could go about it:

If you want to embed a ClojureScript REPL on your blog or website,

* Klipse provides a really easy way to do this
  - just include the klipse script and any code blocks become editable
    * users appreciate it
    * its easy!

* Replumb is what Power Turtle uses as a REPL
  - Takes more effort, and provides more control
  
Power Turtle puts Replumb and Turtle together.

# Learning Clojure through Logo

1. Easy to get started (nothing to install)
2. Fun (it's Logo)
3. Learn programming through Logo
4. in Clojure
5. Transcend Logo into Clojure

???

Which brings us back to Learning Clojure through Logo...

Clojure can be a great beginners language.

We've built a programming experience in Power Turtle that is:
* Easy to get started - nothing to install
* Delivers the fun of Logo
* Has a clear progression of concepts to learn
* Blurs the boundaries of Logo into Clojure
